\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

The period in the history of the Universe characterized by the transition of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) to a fully ionized state due to the formation of radiating objects such as the first stars and galaxies is referred to as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This is an important period of nonlinear growth of matter density perturbations and astrophysical evolution leading to the large scale structure observed currently in the Universe. And yet, this period in the Universe's history has remained poorly probed to date with observations. 

The redshifted neutral hydrogen from the IGM in this epoch has been identified to be one of the most promising and direct probes of the EoR \citep{sun72,sco90,mad97,toz00,ili02}. Numerous experiments using low frequency radio telescopes targeting the redshifted 21~cm line from the spin-flip transition of H{\sc i} have become operational such as the Murchison Widefield Array \citep[MWA;][]{lon09,bow13,tin13}, the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization \citep[PAPER;][]{par10}, the Low Frequency Array \citep[LOFAR;][]{van13} and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope EoR experiment \citep[GMRT;][]{pac13}. These instruments have sufficient sensitivity for a statistical detection of the EoR signal via estimating the spatial power spectrum of the redshifted H{\sc i} temperature fluctuations \citep{bea13,thy13}. These instruments are intended to be precursors and pathfinders to the next generation of low frequency radio observatories such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array\footnote{\url{http://reionization.org/}} (HERA; DeBoer~et~al.~2015) and the Square Kilometre Array\footnote{\url{https://www.skatelescope.org/}} (SKA). These next-generation instruments will advance the capability from a mere statistical detection of the signal to a direct three-dimensional tomographic imaging of the H{\sc i} during the EoR. 

The most significant challenge to low frequency EoR observations arises from the extremely bright Galactic and extragalactic foreground synchrotron emission which are $\sim 10^4$ times stronger than the desired EoR signal \citep{dim02,ali08,ber09,ber10,gho12}. All the current and future instruments rely on the inherent differences in spatial isotropy and spectral smoothness between the EoR signal and the foregrounds to extract the EoR power spectrum \citep[see, e.g.,][]{fur04,mor04,zal04,san05,fur06,mcq06,mor06,wan06,gle08}. 

When expressed in the coordinate system of power spectrum measurements described by the three-dimensional wavenumber ($k$), the foreground emission is restricted to a wedge-shaped region commonly referred to as the {\it foreground wedge} \citep{bow09,liu09,liu14a,liu14b,dat10,liu11,gho12,mor12,par12b,tro12,ved12,dil13,pob13,thy13,dil14} whereas the EoR signal has spherical symmetry due to its isotropy which appears elongated along line of sight $k$ modes due to peculiar velocity effects when dominated by matter density perturbations during early stages of reionization. The extreme dynamic range required to subtract foregrounds precisely demands high precision modeling of foregrounds as observed by modern wide-field instruments \citep{,thy15a,thy15b}.

\subsection{The Wide-Field ``Pitchfork'' Effect}\label{sec:wide-field}

\citep{thy15a,thy15b}

\section{Simulations}\label{sec:sim}

We simulate wide-field visibilities for 19-element HERA from all-sky antenna power pattern and foreground models using the PRISim\footnote{The Precision Radio Interferometry Simulator (PRISim) is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/nithyanandan/PRISim}{https://github.com/nithyanandan/PRISim}} software package. The simulations cover 24~hr of observation in {\it drift} mode consisting of 80 accumulations spanning 1080~s each. The total bandwidth is 100~MHz centered on 150~MHz consisting of 128 channels with 781.125~kHz frequency resolution each. Models of the antenna power pattern and foregrounds are described below.

\subsection{Antenna Power Pattern}

\citep{neb15}

\subsection{Foreground Model}\label{sec:foreground}

Our all-sky foreground model is the same as the one in \citet{thy15a}. It consists of diffuse emission \citep{deo08} and point sources. The latter is obtained from a combination of the NRAO VLA Sky Survey \citep[NVSS;][]{con98} at 1.4~GHz and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey \citep[SUMSS;][]{boc99,mau03} at 843~MHz with a mean spectral index of -0.83. The diffuse sky model has an angular resolution of 13\farcm 74.

\section{Chromaticity of Power Pattern}

The equation for delay spectrum describes the mapping between sky location of a foreground object and delay. The chromatic nature (variation with frequency) of the antenna power pattern results in a convolution of the geometrical mapping with the delay response of spectral chromaticity of the power pattern. This can result in a significant spillover of foreground power beyond the horizon delay limits especially in the case of foregrounds near the horizon. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:off-axis-beam-chromaticity} demonstrates the beyond-the-horizon spillover even from a flat-spectrum point source at different off-axis angles. The three panels correspond to delay spectra from different positions of the point source -- 0\arcdeg (left), 45\arcdeg (middle) and 89\arcdeg (right) -- from the zenith. The phase centers are located at the source positions and hence the delay spectra are centered on $\tau = 0$~ns. The response of the simulated dish power pattern (dashed line) is comapred with that from an {\it Airy} pattern resulting from a nominal uniformly illuminated circular disk (solid line). The gray vertical lines correspond to the horizon limits at $\pm 48.7$~ns for a 14.6~m antenna spacing.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{off-axis_point_source_beam_chromaticity.eps}
\caption{Chromaticity of antenna power pattern at directions off-axis. }
\label{fig:off-axis-beam-chromaticity}
\end{figure*}

At 0\arcdeg off-axis, the {\it Airy} pattern has no spectral variation and thus appears as a straight vertical line centered at $\tau = 0$~ns whereas the simulated power pattern is found to exhibit some spectral variation giving rise to the wings on either side of $\tau = 0$~ns. As off-axis angle increases to 45\arcdeg, both the power patterns clearly exhibit chromaticity. They have similar magnitudes inside the horizon limits but the chromaticity of the simulated power pattern is $\sim 100$ times higher than that of an {\it Airy} pattern outside the horizon limits. In contrast, at 89\arcdeg off-axis, the two patterns have similar chromaticity in delay modes outside the horizon limits but the simulated power pattern has $\sim 100$ times more power inside the horizon limits indicating that the overall amplitude of the pattern at this location is higher relative to the nominal {\it Airy} pattern.

It is important to note that in a generic scenario where visibilities are not phased to a specific foreground location, the chromaticity of the power pattern will imprint itself on location of the foreground objects in delay space and will give rise to significant spillover especially from foregrounds near the horizon. 

We investigate the effects of spectral chromaticity of the power pattern in more detail below.

\subsection{Directional Chromaticity of Power Pattern}

We generalize the analysis above by computing the delay power spectrum of the power pattern along its spectral axis in every direction in an effort to study its performance as a function of angle on the sky. 
\begin{align}
  A^\prime(l,m,\tau) &= \int A(l,m,f)\,e^{-j 2\pi f\tau} \,\dif f
\end{align}

We define the directional chromaticity of antenna power pattern as:
\begin{align}
  C(l,m) &= \frac{ \int\limits_{|\tau|>60\,\textrm{ns}} |A^\prime|^2 \,\dif\tau }{\int\limits_{|\tau|>60\,\textrm{ns}} \dif\tau}
\end{align}
where, the limit $|\tau|>60$~ns was chosen to represent a region well beyond the horizon limits ($\pm 48.7$~ns) for a 14.6~m antenna spacing. It thus measures the average power arising out of chromaticity in each delay mode beyond $|\tau|>60$~ns. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:directional-beam-chromaticity} shows the directional chromaticity, $C(l,m)$, of the power patterns of an {\it Airy} disk for reference (left) and a simulated disk (middle) on an orthographic projection onto direction cosines. Their color scale is shown at the top for reference. The chromaticity of the {\it Airy} pattern is symmetric and always below 500. On the other hand,  a simulated disk exhibits higher levels of chromaticity in the range 100--50,000. The ratio of their chromaticities is shown on the right with corresponding color scale on its right. The simulated disk is more chromatic than the nominal {\it Airy} disk by a factor between 100 and up to 10000. However, chromaticity in regions near the horizon which map to the horizon limits in the delay spectrum and have the most significant impact on spillover into the {\it EoR window} in the simulated disk are higher than that of an {\it Airy} disk only by factors $\lesssim 4$. Thus the simulated disk for HERA achieves reasonable control on the chromaticity near the horizon despite the very high levels near the center. 

Also shown are the tracks (black dots) of point sources brighter than 50~Jy in the LST range 0--12~hrs. The solid circle near the bottom denotes the south celestial pole. It is noted that there are a few bright point sources that spend a majority of time in this LST range near the northern and southern horizons which will contaminate the measured visibilities on north-south antenna spacings. Future simulations of the dish power pattern must take the bright foreground locations, especially near the horizon, into account.
